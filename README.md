in this fun and creative YouTube video, we will explore how to create a smiling egg shape using just HTML and CSS! Join us as we dive into the world of web development and learn how to code a simple yet adorable smiling egg shape entirely with HTML and CSS.

We will start by setting up our HTML structure, creating the basic shape of the egg using div elements, and applying CSS styling to give it a smooth and glossy appearance. Then, we will add eyes, eyebrows, and a mouth to bring our egg to life, making it smile with CSS properties such as border-radius, box-shadow, and transform.

Throughout the video, we will explain each step in detail, making it easy to follow along even if you're new to web development. We'll also provide the GitHub repository link, so you can download the code and experiment with it on your own.

As a bonus, we'll also show you a live preview of the smiling egg shape in action, so you can see the end result before you try it yourself. You'll be amazed at how simple it is to create an adorable smiling egg shape using just HTML and CSS!
